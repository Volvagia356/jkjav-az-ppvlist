This repository contains vaccine registration statistics scrapped from
Malaysia's AstraZeneca vaccine registration campaign at 12PM on 2021-05-02.

An API was used to provide vaccination location and availability data to the
frontend. Although not shown to the user, there is a "balance" field, which is
probably the amount of remaining slots for that location and date.

Each JSON file is the data returned by that API, at the time stated in the
filename. The log.py script was used to call the API and create those files.

The convert.py script is used to transform the data in the JSON files into a
CSV file for easier parsing in a spreadsheet program. The data.csv file is the
output of that script.

The data.ods spreadsheet contains the data from data.csv, along with some
quickly made charts to visualise the data.

==========

For the 2nd round of registration, scraped from 2021-05-23 to 2021-05-26, only
the availability of a date/venue is known, not the actual amount.

There are gaps in the data due to server load, and CloudFlare being
introduced. Any CloudFlare error pages are still scraped into the *.json
files.

The scrape rate is manually adjusted over time to avoid unnecessary amounts of
requests.
