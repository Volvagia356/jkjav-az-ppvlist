This repository contains vaccine registration statistics scrapped from
Malaysia's AstraZeneca vaccine registration campaign at 12PM on 2021-05-02.

An API was used to provide vaccination location and availability data to the
frontend. Although not shown to the user, there is a "balance" field, which is
probably the amount of remaining slots for that location and date.

Each JSON file is the data returned by that API, at the time stated in the
filename. The log.py script was used to call the API and create those files.

The convert.py script is used to transform the data in the JSON files into a
CSV file for easier parsing in a spreadsheet program. The data.csv file is the
output of that script.

The data.ods spreadsheet contains the data from data.csv, along with some
quickly made charts to visualise the data.
